# üß† MNIST PyTorch Training Project

## üöÄ Project Description
Welcome to the **MNIST PyTorch Training Project**! This repository showcases a complete machine learning workflow for classifying handwritten digits using PyTorch. The code is modular, well-documented, and perfect for learning, experimenting, or building upon. 

## ‚ú® Features
- **Lab 1**
  - üì¶ Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset
  - üß© Defines a simple feedforward neural network for digit classification
  - üèãÔ∏è Trains and validates the model with detailed logging
  - üîÆ Predicts and logs results for sample images
  - üõ†Ô∏è Modular codebase for easy extension
- **Lab 2**
  - üñºÔ∏è Loads and reshapes sample images from the MNIST dataset
  - üìä Visualizes and saves reshaped images for inspection
  - üß™ Demonstrates basic data exploration and visualization techniques
  - üìù Includes extra comments and logging for ML beginners
- **Lab 3**
  - ü§ü Loads and preprocesses American Sign Language (ASL) MNIST-style data
  - üß† Builds a convolutional neural network (CNN) for ASL sign classification
  - üîÑ Reshapes and visualizes input data for CNN compatibility
  - üèãÔ∏è Trains and validates the CNN model with detailed logging
  - üõ†Ô∏è Modular and beginner-friendly code with extra comments

## üèÅ Getting Started
1. ‚¨áÔ∏è Clone the repository.
2. üì¶ Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## üé® Code Style & Rules
- üìù Follows [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) guidelines
- üìö All functions include docstrings and type hints
- ü™µ Logging is used for all major steps and errors
- üõ°Ô∏è Exception handling is present for critical operations
- üß© Modular structure: data, device, helper, and lab logic are separated
